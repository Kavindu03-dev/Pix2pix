## 0. Cold Open / Hook (0:00–0:20)

Narration
- Today, I’ll turn simple inputs into compelling images using Pix2Pix—an image-to-image translation model. We’ll go from dataset to trained results and evaluate image quality step by step, all in one notebook.

On-screen
- Quick montage: before→after pairs flashing (3–4 examples). If you don’t have your own yet, show sample pairs from the chosen dataset page.

Editor notes
- Fast cuts synced to music hits; add a 4–6 word overlay: "Sketch to Photo", "Map to Aerial", "Edges to Shoes".
- Add subtle glitch or zoom transition into the title.

Music/SFX
- Upbeat tech/lofi bed, low volume; small whoosh into title.

## 1. Title + What You’ll Learn (0:20–0:45)

Narration
- Welcome! In this short walkthrough we’ll: set up a real dataset, run Pix2Pix training, generate results, and measure quality with metrics like SSIM and LPIPS. Whether you’re new to GANs or refreshing your skills, you’ll leave with a complete, working pipeline.

On-screen
- Title card: "Pix2Pix: Image-to-Image Translation — Complete Workflow".
- Bulleted overlay: Dataset → Train → Inference → Evaluation.

Editor notes
- Clean title animation, then cut to desktop.

## 2. What is Pix2Pix? (0:45–1:30)

Narration
- Pix2Pix is a conditional GAN that learns to translate one type of image into another—like edges to photos or maps to satellite imagery. The generator uses a U-Net with encoder–decoder skip connections to preserve spatial detail. The discriminator is a PatchGAN, which judges realism patch-by-patch, encouraging sharp textures. Training minimizes an adversarial loss plus an L1 reconstruction loss to keep outputs close to the target.

On-screen
- Simple diagram: input → U-Net generator → output; output + target → PatchGAN discriminator → real/fake.

Graphics cue (GenAI prompt)
- "Create a clean, flat vector diagram showing: Input image → U-Net generator (encoder–decoder with skip connections) → Output image. Another arrow: Output + Target → PatchGAN discriminator (grid of patches). Modern colors, minimal labels, 16:9, high contrast on dark background."

Editor notes
- Animate arrows and labels subtly. Keep diagram on screen while speaking.

---

## 3. Dataset Options (1:30–2:20)

Narration
- We’ll use a real paired dataset so results are meaningful. Good beginner options: Maps (maps↔aerial), CMP Facades (facade labels↔photo), or Edges2Shoes. Each example has aligned input–target pairs, ideal for Pix2Pix.
- I’ll show how to point the notebook to a dataset folder and preview a few pairs before training.

On-screen
- Show dataset pages briefly (scroll capture):
  - Official Pix2Pix sample datasets (maps, facades, edges2shoes). Verify current host; alternatives are common mirrors.
  - CMP Facades: http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/
- Show local folder structure: `data/<dataset-name>/train` and `data/<dataset-name>/val` with paired images or split subfolders as your notebook expects.

Callout overlay
- "Use paired datasets with aligned inputs and targets."

Editor notes
- If licensing is restrictive, note it on-screen and recommend using sample subsets for demos.

---

## 4. Notebook Tour (2:20–3:10)

Narration
- Here’s the notebook we’ll run: `pix2pix.ipynb`. It’s organized for a smooth flow: imports and config, dataset setup and preview, model and losses, training loop with checkpoints, and finally inference and evaluation.

On-screen
- Open `pix2pix.ipynb` in VS Code. Scroll to show major sections visually. Do not change code—only run.

Lower-third
- "All code is already provided in `pix2pix.ipynb`."

Editor notes
- Add a subtle highlight box when pointing to section headers.

---

## 5. Data Prep & Preview (3:10–4:00)

Narration
- Place your dataset in a `data` folder within the project. Update the dataset path in the first config cell if needed, then run the data-loading cell. We should see a few input–target previews to confirm alignment.

On-screen
- Show the dataset folder inside the repo root: `data/maps` or `data/facades`.
- In the notebook: run the configuration and data preview cells. Pause briefly on a 3×3 grid preview if available.

Callout overlay
- "Check pairs are aligned and sized as expected."

Editor notes
- Freeze on a clean before/after pair moment; add a wipe transition mimicking the translation.

---

## 6. Architecture & Losses, Briefly (4:00–4:50)

Narration
- The generator is a U-Net encoder–decoder with skip connections. The discriminator is a PatchGAN, classifying N×N patches. We optimize a sum of adversarial loss and L1 loss: adversarial pushes realism, L1 keeps it close to ground truth. This combo yields sharp and faithful outputs.

On-screen
- Quick glance at the model definition cells. Point at lines that mention U-Net blocks and PatchGAN.

Graphics cue (GenAI prompt)
- "Design a one-slide summary: 'Pix2Pix Objective = GAN Loss + λ·L1' with brief notes: 'GAN → realism', 'L1 → faithfulness'. Clean typography, dark theme, 16:9, space for small equation."

Editor notes
- Keep this section brisk; it’s context, not a deep dive.

---

## 7. Training Run (4:50–6:20)

Narration
- Let’s train. I’ll keep the epochs short for the demo so you can see progress quickly. As batches stream, watch the loss curves or sample outputs update. The notebook also saves checkpoints, so you can resume or test intermediate results.

On-screen
- Run the training cell. Show live output: iteration/epoch numbers, losses, and periodic sample generations if present.

Callout overlays
- "Short demo run: fewer epochs for speed."
- "Checkpoints enable resume/testing."

Editor notes
- Speed up playback (1.5–2×) during training. Cut to periodic sample images.

Music/SFX
- Slightly higher energy while losses scroll; duck under voice.

---

## 8. Inference / Generate Results (6:20–7:10)

Narration
- After training, run the inference cell to translate new inputs. Save outputs to an `outputs` folder and compare side-by-side with targets. Even after a short run, you should see structure and textures improving.

On-screen
- Execute the inference cell. Open the `outputs` directory and flip through generated images.
- Show a split view or slider of input vs output vs target if the notebook provides it.

Lower-third
- "Tip: Keep a few validation pairs aside for fair comparison."

Editor notes
- Add a smooth left–right wipe between input and output.

---

## 9. Evaluation (SSIM, LPIPS) (7:10–8:10)

Narration
- To quantify quality, we’ll compute SSIM for structural similarity and LPIPS for perceptual similarity. SSIM compares luminance, contrast, and structure; higher is better. LPIPS uses deep features; lower is better. After a quick pass, we’ll summarize the averages and a few example scores.

On-screen
- Run the evaluation cell(s). Show printed averages and maybe a small table. If LPIPS isn’t installed in your environment, keep it to SSIM for the demo and mention LPIPS as an option.

Callout overlay
- "SSIM ↑ better; LPIPS ↓ better."

Editor notes
- Add a compact overlay with the final numbers.

---

## 10. Results & Takeaways (8:10–9:00)

Narration
- We trained Pix2Pix end-to-end with a real dataset, generated outputs, and measured quality. For stronger results, train longer, use data augmentation, and tune the L1 weight and learning rate. Try different datasets—maps, facades, edges-to-photo—to see how the model adapts.

On-screen
- Gallery grid: 4–6 before/after examples. End on your best pair.

Callout overlay
- "Next: More epochs, augments, hyperparameter tuning."

Editor notes
- Light push-in on the best example; then fade to credits.

---

## 11. Outro / CTA (9:00–9:20)

Narration
- If this helped, leave a like and share your results. The full notebook is in this repo—run it, tweak it, and show me what you build. Thanks for watching!

On-screen
- Repo name: `Pix2pix` — file: `pix2pix.ipynb`.
- Socials or contact, if applicable.

Music/SFX
- Brief sting; fade out.

## Creative Toolkit and Prompts

Use any of these to elevate visuals. Replace with your preferred tools.

- Intro animation (GenAI prompt)
  - "Generate a 3–5 second intro animation: the text 'Pix2Pix — Image-to-Image Translation' builds from outline to filled, with a subtle pixel-to-photo morph effect. Dark tech aesthetic, 16:9, no logos."
- Lower-thirds pack (GenAI prompt)
  - "Design 3 lower-thirds styles: (1) speaker name and role, (2) tip callout, (3) metric box. Flat, modern, high-contrast, semi-transparent background. Export PNG with alpha."
- Diagram slide (GenAI prompt)
  - "Create a minimal U-Net + PatchGAN diagram for Pix2Pix with labeled blocks and arrows. Keep typography large and readable, 16:9, dark theme."
- Thumbnail concepts (GenAI prompt)
  - "Side-by-side 'Input → Output' with bold text 'Pix2Pix Explained'. Clean background, vibrant colors, readable at small sizes."
- Background music
  - Lofi/techno with clear license; loopable; -16 to -12 LUFS integrated; duck -6 dB when speaking.

---

## On-Screen Steps Checklist (for the recording)

- Show repo root with `pix2pix.ipynb` visible.
- Create `data/<dataset>` folder and place paired data per your notebook’s expectation.
- In notebook: run config/imports → dataset loader → preview pairs.
- Briefly point at model cells (U-Net + PatchGAN) without editing.
- Start training (short demo epochs). Show loss prints and periodic samples.
- Run inference. Open `outputs` and show results.
- Run evaluation; show SSIM/LPIPS summary.
- Show a small gallery of best before/after pairs.

---

## Technical Accuracy Notes

- Model: Generator = U-Net with skip connections; Discriminator = PatchGAN.
- Objective: GAN loss + λ·L1 (L1 encourages outputs close to target; GAN encourages realism).
- Dataset: Paired, aligned inputs and targets (e.g., Maps, CMP Facades, Edges2Shoes).
- Evaluation: SSIM (higher better), LPIPS (lower better). If LPIPS isn’t installed, mention it as optional and proceed with SSIM.
- Repro: Don’t change code on-camera; only run cells as written.

---

## Editing & Presentation Tips

- Pacing: Keep explanations tight; time-compress training sections to save viewer time.
- Clarity: Use zooms and highlights when pointing to important cells.
- Accessibility: Add captions; keep on-screen text high-contrast and brief.
- Consistency: Use a simple, consistent color palette and typography.
- Screen capture: 1080p or 1440p at 60 fps for crisp code and plots.

---

## Optional Advanced Segment (add after 9:20 if you want 1–2 extra minutes)

Narration
- For better performance, increase epochs and use augmentation. You can also compare different λ values for L1 or try perceptual losses. To stabilize training, monitor gradients and use exponential moving averages for generator weights.

On-screen
- Show a comparison grid of short vs long training.

Editor notes
- Keep this add-on optional; only if runtime allows.
